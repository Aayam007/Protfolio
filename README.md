## 📝 Notes

### CSS "Errors" in VS Code:
You may see some CSS lint errors in `style.css` related to grid syntax. These are **false positives** - the CSS is valid and works correctly in all modern browsers. The VS Code CSS parser has trouble with MS Grid prefix syntax.

**Action Required**: None - you can safely ignore these warnings.
